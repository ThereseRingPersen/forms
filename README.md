# Forms

This project is for learning about something as simple as forms. Forms helps us communicate with the user and I will use this project to test myself and improve my knowledge.

## Motivation

Having worked with forms for a while, I wanted to design my own form components. Working on forms a bit I know that there are a lot of opinions about what a good form is, and I never really sat down to make thorough research. So by designing my own form components and implementing what I find appealing and intuitive based on my research at this time I am hoping to create form components that I can use for future reference.

At the same time I am also testing out using styled-components, to see how that is compared to regular CSS/less.

## Inspiration

To make this form I am looking into how others are making forms and why something is done in a specific way.

I am taking my inspiration from larger projects like google's material design, and Shopify's polaris-react for their beautiful designs. But also navs design system not so much for their designs as for their focus on accessibility.

-   https://material.io

And I particularly like material designs thorough and amazing layout in input fields.

I have also found some articles that I find useful in understanding the importance of form components, and that have helped me understand what is good form design, and why.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `tsc --noEmit`

To verify that the code has no type errors.

### `yarn test`

Currently no tests.
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
