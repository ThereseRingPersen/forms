# Forms

Forms helps us communicate with the user and happy users often means money. A form is one of the best ways to get input from prospective customers. When someone uses your app or your website often has a goal,and often the one thing standing between the user and their goal is a form. Forms remain one of the most important types of interactions for users on the web and in apps. Forms are often considered the final step in the journey of completing their goals. Forms are just a means to an end. Users should be able to complete them quickly and without confusion. And I am myself a person that dislike anything confusing. When I want something done, I usually would have liked to have it done yesterday.

## Motivation

This project is for going deeper into forms, I have worked with forms for a while, but as a new developer I have never taken the plunge into figuring out what a good form is. I have mostly relied on designers and senior developers to figure this out for me. But I believe it is important to have an understanding and opinion of this simple yet complex communication form with the user.

I am also testing out some things I have never used before. For a long time I have been dying to try out styled-components. Just to see how that is compared to using less. I am also using hooks to control the form, just for the sake of it. Previously I have worked with react-form and Formik, and I like it. But new is always better...

## Inspiration

To make this form I am looking into how others are making forms and why something is done in a specific way.

I am taking my inspiration from larger projects like google's material design, and Shopify's polaris-react for their beautiful designs. But also NAV's design system, but not so much for their cute designs as for their focus on accessibility.

-   https://material.io
-   https://design.nav.no

And I particularly like material designs thorough and amazing layout in input fields.

I have also found some articles that I find useful in understanding the importance of form components, and that have helped me understand what is good form design, and why.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `tsc --noEmit`

To verify that the code has no type errors.

### `yarn test`

Currently no tests.
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
